# **Programming Fundamental Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

## **Introduction**  
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic 3x3 grid-based game implemented in C++. Two players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols. This project provides an engaging console-based experience for players while showcasing fundamental programming concepts.
